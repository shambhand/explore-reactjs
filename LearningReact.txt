React Elements:Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps; Its what you are see on the screen.

##React Components: A react component is javasctipt class or function that rertuns React Element

##React Props:

##Why Components:
  -can split our UI into independent, reusable pieces and think of them in isolation
  - Declarative usage: We can use components in a declarative way
##React.Fragment==> wrap inside a virtual html element which won't be render
## Component:
   - Function Component: Stateless
   - Class Component: Stateful
## States:
    - State is an observable object
	- Do not change state directly
## Lifecycle:
	Series of methods that aee invoked in the different stages of components existence
	Stages:
	  - Initialization
	  - Mounting
  1. Initiailization:
     I this we define  the props and initial state of the component 
  2. Mouting: After the initilization of the component, render method is called first time.  
     It will be done by:
	   componentWillMount() -
	     ==>render() is called in between
	   componentDidMount() -
  3. UnMounting: Final phase of the component. This is where the component gets unmounted from the DOM.
      It will be done by:
	   componentWillUnMount()   
  4. Updating: In this phase state or props are updated
      It will be done by:
	  - Update by some user events
	  - Methods in this phase:
	     componentWillReceiveProps()
		 setState()
		 shouldComponentUpdate() ?--> boolean 
		 componentWillUpdate() --> Before the update
		     render()get called in between 
		 componentDidUpdate()  --> after the update

##Creating Form Component:	

## DOM, Virtual DOM, DIffing Algorithm:

## React Hooks:

  Effect hooks: Lets you perform side effects in your functional components
  
  Custom Hooks: lets you extract components logic into reusable function
